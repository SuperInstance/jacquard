# Builder's log

Written as the work happens: decisions, reasons, dead ends,
deviations. Newest entries at the bottom of each day.

## 2026-11-02 — Phase 1 build begins

**Authorisation.** Casey, 2026-11-02 10:20 AKST: "get Jeckard
built." The repo is built under the spelling **jacquard** (the name
from the naming discussion; the go message's spelling is treated
as a typo and the discrepancy is flagged to Casey in the report).
Build base: the clean-sheet design (context pack docs 08-10).
Phase 1 = this repo + spec + Python reference kernel + the replay
acceptance suite. Public surface uses plain engineering language
only (a Casey ruling): proposal, tentative state, committed state,
candidate, decision, standing rule, definition, dictionary,
producer record, decision queue, state export bundle.

**Where.** Built on the Oracle (booked on the agent-inbox schedule
board, lane `jacquard-build`, commit 5470bcd) — not the Thor, which
is Casey's bench and was touched read-only only, to fetch the
queue record below. Oracle disk is 93% full; the repo stays small
and no model work happens here.

**The replay dataset is real.** The Thor's GPU successor-queue
record (`~/gpu-queue/`: `events.jsonl`, `queue.json`, `idle.jsonl`,
`daemon.py`) was fetched read-only and copied unchanged to the
build (events.jsonl md5 f9a10545d47d4e16c6b993a3e9c6a3d5). The
daemon source (`daemon.py`) is the ground truth for the rule the
replay must reproduce:

- A finite job dispatches only if another job is queued behind it
  or the feeder is enabled; otherwise it holds, recorded against
  its lane.
- A job failing to start twice (nonzero exit inside a 25 s grace)
  halts dispatching.
- Foreign GPU work (utilisation > 15%) pre-empts a tick.
- The feeder materialises one job at a time when the queue is
  empty: rotation [fishing_boat, harbor_house, pier, spruce],
  count 8, seed step 1000.

**What the record actually contains (measured, not assumed):**
1,637 jobs — 2 finite + 1,635 feeder — every one done, exit 0,
attempt 1. Zero failures, zero holds, zero halts in the recorded
window (2026-10-27 23:22 to 2026-10-28 18:41 AKST). All 1,137 idle
intervals start after the run ended and were closed by foreign
work. Consequences for the acceptance suite, stated now so the
verdicts later are honest:

- Dispatch reproduction is fully testable on real data: the kernel
  replay must produce the recorded sequence of 1,637 dispatches,
  in order, serially, with zero holds (matching the record).
- The hold branch and the two-failure halt have **zero instances**
  in the real record. They will be covered by synthetic fixtures
  derived line-by-line from `daemon.py`, stored under
  `tests/data/synthetic/` and marked RECONSTRUCTED wherever they
  are used. No verdict will claim real-data coverage for them.

**Spec decisions taken while writing SPEC.md v0.1:**
- Canonical form: JSON, sorted keys, no whitespace, **no floats**
  (quantities are integers in stated units). Float canonicalisation
  across languages is a known trap; integers remove it.
- Refusal vocabulary: the design record's names plus
  UNDERDECLARED for effect under-declaration (proposals and
  definitions). The record's CLASS was doing this job loosely;
  the acceptance criteria require the refusal to be *named*, so it
  gets its own name, recorded here as a deliberate spec addition.
- Word-language syntax forms (`dup drop swap over snoc assoc getf
  first cat`) are evaluator syntax, not primitives: they touch no
  state and grant no effects. Primitive count stays exactly the
  26 of the design (18 Tier-P + 8 Tier-E). Both counts are stated
  wherever the number matters, so the kill criterion ("primitives
  balloon past ~40") is judged on the open: 26 primitives + 9
  syntax forms.
- Feeder materialisation in the replay is environment, not kernel
  policy (the daemon itself is the feeder's owner): the replay
  harness's feeder adapter submits the recorded feeder jobs as
  proposals; the kernel's policy decides their dispatch. What the
  acceptance test pins is the kernel's decisions, which is what
  the criteria are about.
- The queue policy words operate on the head of the queue read
  from committed state (the daemon's rule is head-of-queue), a
  small deviation from the design record's per-job word sketch;
  the words keep the record's names where they fit
  (feeder-on?, dispatchable?, maybe-dispatch, record-hold).
